# MSc Dissertation

## DESCRIPTION

This repository contains the report and some of the codes written during my MSc research. The research studied the effect of transient temperature chnage on the adsorption process in water silica-gel systems.

The repository is structured as follows:
- Literature Review: this contains a review of the adsorption process and finite elment method. It also contains a basic finite element code for transient heat tranfer in a rectangular domain.
- Research Proposal: this contains a report of case studies and tests of codes to be used in the major research.
- Major Research: this contains the final report, and some of the codes developed for the coupled adsorption and heat transfer model.
